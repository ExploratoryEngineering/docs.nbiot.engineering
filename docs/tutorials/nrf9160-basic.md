We've created a new [repository for nrf9160 samples][1] that should be easier to setup than before, and also included a sample for Firmware Over The Air updating. Please follow the readme in the [nrf9160-telenor][1] repository.

### Virtual Machine

Users of most operating systems have the option of working from inside a virtual machine, using e.g. Virtual Box.  This option is available in case the operating system-specific instructions in later sections do not work for you. Please see the [VirtualBox tutorial](nrf9160-basic/virtualbox.html) for instructions if this is your situation (not updated with the new samples just yet).
