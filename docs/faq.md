## NB-IoT and LTE Cat M1 (LTE-M)

### What is NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT)?

First release was in release 13 of 3GPP standards. It's also called Cat-M2, but most widely referred to as NB-IoT. It's not using LTE radio, like 4G and LTE Cat M1, but is rather based on direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation.

The duplex mode is half duplex, and the bandwidth is 250 Kbps downlink and 20 Kbps (single-tone) / 250 Kbps (multi-tone) uplink. The latency is between 1.6s and 10s.

### What is LTE Cat M1, LTE-M or eMTC?

First relase was in release 13 of 3GPP standards, much like NB-IoT. It seems like the term LTE-M is getting more adoption in the industry, but the official names are LTE Cat M1 and eMTC. Some also refer to the as Cat-M1.

The duplex mode is full duplex, and the bandwidth is 1Mbps downlink and 1Mbps uplink. The latency is between 10ms and 15ms.
