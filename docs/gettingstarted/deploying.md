After building, the `build` folder contains standalone, static html files that can be published to any web server.

Make sure that your `config/config.js` variable `webRoot` matches the root folder of where the documentation will be hosted. For example: if you plan on hosting the documentation at `https://you.github.io/your-documentation`, the `webRoot` should be `/your-documentation/`.
